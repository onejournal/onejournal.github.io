              <p class="lh-copy measure f3 black-70 baskerville">
                "In the coming 6G communications, the internet of
                  things (IoT) serves as a key enabler to collect environmental
                  information and is expected to achieve ubiquitous deployment.
                  However, it is challenging for traditional IoT sensors to meet
                  this demand because of their requirement of power supplies
                  and frequent maintenance, which is due to their sense-thentransmit working principle. To address this challenge, we propose
                  a meta-IoT sensing system, where the IoT sensors are based on
                  specially designed meta-materials. The meta-IoT sensors achieve
                  simultaneous sensing and transmission and thus require no power
                  supplies. In order to design a meta-IoT sensing system with
                  optimal sensing accuracy, we jointly consider the sensing and
                  transmission of meta-IoT sensors and propose an efficient algorithm to jointly optimizes the meta-IoT structure and the sensing
                  function at the receiver of the system. As an example, we apply
                  the proposed system and algorithm in sensing environmental
                  temperature and humidity levels. Simulation results show that
                  by using the proposed algorithm, the sensing accuracy can be
                  significantly increased.",the abstract of the paper stated.
                </p>
              <p class="lh-copy measure f3 black-70 baskerville">  
                This vision would need deploying almost 10-fold(10 million devices per square km) more than that deployed in 5g. This would also need them 
                to be battery-free, energy-efficient and to be used without human maintanence for a longer duration.
                Therefore, making it a challenging for currently existing IoT sensors to satisfy the demands for 6g, as the research paper suggests.
              </p>
              <p class="lh-copy measure f3 black-70 baskerville">
                Due the fact that the existing IoT sensors do not
                support simultaneous sensing and transmission, and thus need
                power supplies, such as lithium batteries, for modulating and
                transmitting sensing results. The modulation of sensing results
                and the antenna requirements for transmitting signals of the
                IoT sensors result in non-negligible power, price, and space
                demands for active sensors, which makes them not suitable
                for imperceptible mass deployment.
              </p>
              <p class="lh-copy measure f3 black-70 baskerville">
                So in order to meet the demand for
                 environment sensing,the paper suggests, it is necessary to develop
                sensors with simultaneous sensing and transmission, which
                means that sensing results can be carried back by wireless
                signals reflected on it without any modulation.
              </p>
              <p class="lh-copy measure f3 black-70 baskerville">
                The paper thus refers to use of meta-iot sensors. The meta-IoT sensors are printed circuits
                on supportive substrates combined with some sensitive materials, which together work as reflectors for wireless signals.
                The working principle is that their reflection coefficients for
                wireless signals are sensitive to surrounding physical conditions. As a result, by analyzing the reflected signals from the
                meta-IoT sensors, the influence of the physical conditions can
                be recognized. Such wireless transceivers can be part of the
                traditional wireless sensor networks or the equipment carried
                by the UAVs for sensing applications, so the meta-IoT
                sensors can be merged into existing IoT framework.
